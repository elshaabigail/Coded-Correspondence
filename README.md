# Coded-Correspondence
A project to encode and decode message using cryptography algorithms.

In this project, we will both encode and decode various messages from our fictional cryptographer Vishal using Caesar Cipher and Vigenere Cipher. In this scenario, us and Vishal have been exchanging letters for quite some time now and have started to provide a puzzle in each one of our letters.

This project is part of the Codecademy Data Science Foundations career path and specifically belongs to the module titled "Python Fundamentals for Data Science (Part II)".
